# Personal Information Survey

The Personal Information Survey is a brief questionnaire that is first answered before the interview process starts, and can be updated as is necessary. The purpose of the Survey is to help employees and interviewees more respectfully communicate with each other. It includes such information as:

1. **Name** to use when referring to and addressing them.
2. **Pronouns** to use when referring to them.
3. **Title** to use when addressing them in a formal context.
4. **Time zone** they live in, so we can more effectively plan meetings.
5. **Notes on communication** for them to explain any needs or limitations they have regarding communication.

## Process

Interviewees will be sent a copy of the Survey as the first step of the interview process, and the process will not move forward until it is filled out and returned.

Before and during the interview process, an individual's responses to the Survey will only be given to those facilitating the interview process, the interviewer(s) themselves, and others who are _required_ to work with them during the interview process. If they are hired, it will be added to the internal collection of Personal Information Surveys.

Legal name, assigned gender, any information regarding mental health, and things of that sort should not be collected in the Survey nor requested alongside it, to avoid unintentional leaking of that information. If information such as legal name and assigned gender is required for any part of the hiring process, it should be requested separately â€” e.g., in a separate email thread. If they disclose such information in their responses during the interview process, an interview facilitator should ask if the interviewee to send an updated response with such information removed. An exception can be made if the they believe the information is necessary for effectively communicating with them.

The Survey should explicitly state that it will be given to the rest of the team if they are hired and that they are free to update their responses at any time. There should be a separate way for them to pass information to the interview facilitator(s) and/or interviewer(s) privately, in case there is anything they would prefer to not have mentioned to the entire team (e.g., anything listed at the beginning of the previous paragraph). If they are hired, they should be prompted to make any changes, if necessary.

Individuals should be able to update their information without question nor gatekeeping. Employees should always be able to easily access the latest responses for all other employees.
