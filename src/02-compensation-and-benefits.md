# Compensation + Benefits

## Compensation

Compensation at Zinc is separated into billable and un-billable work. Each pay
period, we decide as a team how many days per week we can work on either
billable or non-billable projects.

Billable work is compensated at $300 per day.
Non-billable work is compensated at $120 per day.

Every half-day worked on both billable and non-billable work adds a share for
the worker into our profit sharing pool, which gets paid out monthly out of the
previous quarters profits.

Zinc employees recieve payment for work on the 15th and last business day of the month.
Contractors receive payment upon receipt of invoice.
